# Demo

This demo contains a Surface Live Component: `Counter` in the file `lib/demo_web/components/counter.ex` and a test file for that component in `test/demo_web/components/counter_test.exs`

The test file contains a successful and a failing error.

The failing error is most likely due to the default prop assigns.
